# earthranger_tableau_integration_maps

I completed this project for Loisaba Conservancy during an intership I completed there during the fall of 2022. The maps and figures below are part of monthly automated tableau reports of wildlife sightings around the conservancy.
I also created a semi-automated process for tracking and visualizing touristic game drive paths and sightings. The maps were posted to a private link online for tourist groups to access.
This new data helped with management of game drive paths, and also supplemented wildlife sighting data informing conservancy management decisions.
